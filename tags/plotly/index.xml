      <description>Back in August, the press informed that Lionel Messi wanted to leave FC Barcelona, the only team in his professional career. Barcelona was not ready to let him go without a fight, and eventually he was convinced (or his lawyers were convinced) he should stay for a least another season.
Being one of the most relevant football player of his generation, he attracts a lot of business opportunities for Barcelona - so the financial reasons for trying him to stay are obvious.</description>

      <description>Indicators… albeit very useful to synthesise concepts, they are also good at hiding variations and putting slightly different situations into just one bucket. Sometimes the devil is in the details, and when we look through these generalisations we risk an overly simplistic view of things. Many argue this is case with the Human Development Index (HDI).
The HDI aims to incorporate health and education measurements into a more balanced development metric.</description>
