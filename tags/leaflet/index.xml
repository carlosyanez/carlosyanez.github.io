      <description>Indicators… albeit very useful to synthesise concepts, they are also good at hiding variations and putting slightly different situations into just one bucket. Sometimes the devil is in the details, and when we look through these generalisations we risk an overly simplistic view of things. Many argue this is case with the Human Development Index (HDI).
The HDI aims to incorporate health and education measurements into a more balanced development metric.</description>

      <description>Updated on 4 July 2020: added postcodes 3031 and 3051.
From midnight Wednesday, 10 Melbourne postcode areas will enter lockdown, to contain the spread of covid-19. As per the news report, the areas are 3012, 3021, 3032, 3038, 3042, 3046, 3047, 3055, 3060, 3064.
Although my postcode is not listed, it is in one of previously mentioned hot spot LGAs. So, to better understand which are exactly the places in lock down, I put them in the above map.</description>
