As part of my uni studies, I had to prepare a presentation on how big data analytics has to consider existing data privacy regulations. This work was done based on the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, but these principles also exist in the current UK GDPR and other frameworks like (EU) GDPR or the [Australian Privacy Principles.](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles)
