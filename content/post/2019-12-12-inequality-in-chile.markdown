**tldr: **Yes, income is distributed unequally in Chile. This is especially true when compared with *developed nations* but it is not unique - countries in Latin America have the same issue. Observed by income deciles, there is an acute gap between the poorest and wealthiest groups. However, we need to acknowledge that both inequality and income for all groups have only become better in the last 25 years - Chile is a success story. There is room and resources to address the most acute differences today - the challenge in the long term is how to grow in a way that wealth is better distributed.
