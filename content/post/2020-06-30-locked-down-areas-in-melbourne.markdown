**[Updated on 4 July 2020](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-04/victoria-coronavirus-cases-rise-by-108-lockdown-new-postcodes/12422456):** added postcodes **3031** and **3051.**




From midnight Wednesday, 10 Melbourne [**postcode areas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_Australia) will enter lockdown, to contain the spread of covid-19. As per the [news report](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-30/victoria-coronavirus-hotspot-local-lockdowns-in-melbourne/12407138), the areas are **3012, 3021, 3032, 3038, 3042, 3046, 3047, 3055, 3060, 3064**.







Although my postcode is not listed, it is in one of previously mentioned **hot spot** [LGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Australia). So, to better understand which are exactly the places in lock down, I put them in the above map.
