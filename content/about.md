---

Southern hemisphere dweller, with dual allegiance to the land at the end of the world and the lucky country. Husband and father of a son.

After a career in IT, Iâ€™m trying to interpret and make sense of the world through data. Currently progressing in my MSc in Data Analytics with the University of Glasgow.

I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land where I work and live. I pay my respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging.
